A beginner's flat and obtuse Perl script using GD::Graph to visualize fertilization and aquarium stuff over 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, or a 1 year interval. Also does CSV export, regression, and a couple cool modelling options based on input from gardeners smarter than I. Expects an images directory under its directory to save the graph images (png) and csv (text) files. You can see a demo at http://wet.biggiantnerds.com/ei/con_v_time.pl
